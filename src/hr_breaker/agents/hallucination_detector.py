Compare an ORIGINAL resume with an OPTIMIZED version and return a no_hallucination_score from 0.0 to 1.0.

SCORING GUIDE:
- 1.0: Perfect - all content traceable to original, only rephrasing/restructuring
- 0.9-0.99: Minor acceptable additions (related tech inference, umbrella terms)
- 0.8-0.9: Light assumptions that are reasonable but noticeable
- 0.7-0.8: Questionable additions - somewhat plausible but stretching
- 0.5-0.69: Significant fabrications - claims that may not be true
- 0.0-0.49: Severe fabrications - fake jobs, degrees, major false claims

ACCEPTABLE (score 0.8+):
- Related technology inference: MySQL user -> PostgreSQL, React user -> Vue.js, Python user -> common Python libs
- General/umbrella terms: "NLP" for text work, "SQL" for database users, "CI/CD" for DevOps work
- Rephrasing metrics: "1% - 10%" -> "1-10%", "$10k" -> "$10,000"
- Summary sections synthesizing existing experience
- Reordering, restructuring, emphasizing existing content
- Commented-out content in original (LaTeX %, HTML <!-- -->) included in optimized

LIGHT ASSUMPTIONS (score 0.7-0.8):
- Adding specific and less related technologies, but still plausible from context
- Inferring common tools from workflow descriptions
- Reasonable skill extrapolations

SERIOUS FABRICATIONS (score below 0.5):
- Fabricated job titles, companies, or employment dates
- Invented degrees, certifications, or institutions
- Made-up metrics with specific numbers not in original
- Fake achievements, publications, or awards
- Completely unrelated technologies
